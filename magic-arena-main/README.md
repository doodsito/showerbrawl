# Magic Arena

A 2D top-down multiplayer wizard PvP game that runs entirely in the browser. Pick one of five spell classes, create a room, share the four letter code with friends, and fight until someone reaches 10 kills.

**Play it now: https://magic-arena-production.up.railway.app**

Built with Phaser 3 on the client and Node.js with Socket.IO on the server. The server owns the whole simulation, so there is no client side cheating: clients only send input and render what the server tells them.

## Quick start

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in two browser tabs (or send the room code to a friend on your network) and start fighting.

## How a match works

1. One player clicks CREATE ROOM and gets a four letter code.
2. Up to 8 players join with that code and pick a class in the lobby.
3. Anyone presses START GAME. The server picks one of three arenas at random.
4. First player to 10 kills wins. A scoreboard appears with a rematch button.
5. Rematch starts a fresh match, new random map, scores reset.

## Controls

| Input       | Action                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
| W/A/S/D     | Move                            |
| Mouse       | Aim                             |
| Left click  | Basic attack (hold to auto fire)|
| Right click | Special ability                 |
| Space       | Dash                            |
| Shift       | Sprint                          |
| Tab (hold)  | Live scoreboard                 |
| M           | Mute sound                      |

## Classes

| Class       | Basic attack      | Special ability                                  |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Pyromancer  | Fireball          | Inferno Wave: cone of fire that burns over time  |
| Frostweaver | Ice Shard (slows) | Glacial Wall: temporary wall that blocks movement|
| Stormcaller | Chain Bolt        | Thunder Strike: delayed AoE blast at range       |
| Hexblade    | Melee slash       | Shadow Bind: projectile that roots the target    |
| Alchemist   | Acid Flask        | Transmute Field: zone that heals you, then hurts enemies |

You can switch class while waiting to respawn, so counterpicking mid match is part of the game.

Other mechanics: killing someone heals you 25 HP, everyone slowly regenerates, fresh spawns get 2 seconds of protection, and every hit applies knockback.

## Architecture notes

- **Server authoritative.** The server runs each room's simulation at 60 fps and handles movement, collision, damage, status effects, and win detection. Clients send `{dx, dy, angle, sprint}` input and ability requests, nothing else.
- **Client interpolation.** Remote players lerp toward their latest server position so movement looks smooth even though state arrives in discrete ticks.
- **Runtime generated assets.** All sprites are drawn to canvases at startup in `sprites.js`, and every sound is synthesized with WebAudio in `sfx.js`. The repo has no image or audio files and no build step.
- **Rooms are isolated.** Each room has its own game loop, map, and state. Empty rooms are cleaned up when the last player disconnects.

## Tuning

Game balance lives in two places in `server/index.js`:

- `CLASSES` defines every class stat: move speed, dash, cooldowns, damage.
- The constants above it (`KILL_LIMIT`, `RESPAWN_TIME`, `SIPHON_HEAL`, `PASSIVE_REGEN`, and so on) control match rules.

Maps are plain string arrays in the `MAPS` object. `#` is a wall, `.` is floor, each cell is 64 pixels. Add a new layout there and it joins the random rotation automatically.

## Deploying

The server reads `PORT` from the environment, so it works out of the box on most Node hosts (Render, Railway, Fly.io, a VPS).

```bash
# from the repo root
npm install
npm start
```

For Render or Railway: point the service at the repo, build command `npm install`, start command `npm start`. Once deployed, everyone with the URL can play together with room codes. WebSockets must be enabled on the host (they are by default on Render and Railway).

The live demo above runs on Railway from this exact repo.
